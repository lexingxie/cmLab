    abstract = {The cumulative effect of collective participation online has an important and adverse impact on individual privacy. As an online system evolves over time, new digital traces of individual behavior may uncover previously hidden statistical links between an individual’s past actions and her private traits. Furthermore, this de-anonymization trend may not be observable when analyzing short or medium time-span snapshots of data. To quantify this effect, we analyze the evolution of individual privacy loss by studying the 13-year long edit history of Wikipedia, including more than 117,523 different users performing 188,805,088 edits. We trace each Wikipedia’s contributor using apparently harmless features, such as the number of edits performed on predefined broad categories in a given time period (e.g. Mathematics, Culture or Nature). We show that even at this unspecific level of identification, it is possible to use off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to uncover usually undisclosed private traits, such as gender, religion or education. We provide empirical evidence that the prediction accuracy for almost all private traits consistently improves over time. Moreover, we observe that the system also shows improved prediction for users who participated in the system during “safe” periods — periods where a given individual’s private traits could not be — showing that de-anonymization threats are hard to foresee as online systems evolve. Insights from this work should help users, system designers, and policy makers understand and debate the design and long-term effects of online content creation systems.},

    abstract={This paper proposes a new representation to explain and predict popularity evolution in social media. Recent work on social networks has led to insights about the popularity of a digital item. For example, both the content and the network matters, and gaining early popularity is critical. However, these observations did not paint a full picture of popularity evolution; some open questions include: what kind of popularity trends exist among different types of videos, and will an unpopular video become popular? To this end, we propose a novel phase representation that extends the well-known endogenous growth and exogenous shock model (Crane and Sornette 2008). We further propose efficient algorithms to simultaneously estimate and segment power-law shaped phases from historical popularity data. With the extracted phases, we found that videos go through not one, but multiple stages of popularity increase or decrease over many months. On a dataset containing the 2-year history of over 172,000 YouTube videos, we observe that phases are directly related to content type and popularity change, e.g., nearly 3/4 of the top 5\% popular videos have 3 or more phases, more than 60\% news videos are dominated by one long power-law decay, and 75\% of videos that made a significant jump to become the most popular videos have been in increasing phases. Finally, we leverage this phase representation to predict future viewcount gain and found that using phase information reduces the average prediction error over the state-of-the-art for videos of all phase shapes.},
