#### **Event Information**

Hosted by the ANU Computational Media Lab in partnership with ANU’s Integrated AI Network and CSIRO’s Data61 Tech4HSE Research Program, this one‑day in‑person event brings together a distinguished group of researchers and practitioners to explore how artificial intelligence can address critical challenges in climate, environmental, and public and industrial safety.

#### **Themes & Focus**

The event spotlights AI’s transformative potential across three interlinked domains:

- Climate Resilience: leveraging predictive modeling and environmental data to support adaptation strategies;

- Safety & Health: using AI to enhance regulatory compliance and training;

- Environmental Monitoring: applying machine learning for ecosystem counting and assessment based on non-traditional data sources.

#### **Takeaways**

- Identify target users and understand their goals, contexts, and constraints. Elicit user requirements and map them to the potential solution space. Ensure the AI system aligns with real user needs rather than abstract technical possibilities.

- The effectiveness of AI models is strongly influenced by the source, quality, and representativeness of training data. Biases or gaps in data can lead to poor generalization or unintended outcomes.

- Natural language is inherently ambiguous and context-dependent. Misinterpretations can arise between human users and LLMs due to differences in assumptions or knowledge.

- AI is not always the best or necessary solution. For certain tasks, AI can support users by recommending or automating traditional approaches (e.g., rule-based methods). In some cases, simpler methods may be more efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy.
