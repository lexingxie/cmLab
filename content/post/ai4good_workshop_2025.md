Hosted by the ANU Computational Media Lab in partnership with ANUâ€™s Integrated AI Network and CSIROâ€™s Data61 Tech4HSE Research Program, this oneâ€‘day inâ€‘person event brings together a distinguished group of researchers and practitioners to explore how artificial intelligence can address critical challenges in climate, environmental, and public and industrial safety.

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Themes & Focus**

The event spotlights AIâ€™s transformative potential across three interlinked domains:

- Climate Resilience: leveraging predictive modeling and environmental data to support adaptation strategies;

- Safety & Health: using AI to enhance regulatory compliance and training;

- Environmental Monitoring: applying machine learning for ecosystem counting and assessment based on non-traditional data sources.
