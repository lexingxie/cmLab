Smallset Timelines, and the associated [R package](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/smallsets/index.html) [smallsets](https://lydialucchesi.github.io/smallsets/), faciliate visual documentation of data preprocessing.

<br/>

Data preprocessing is a crucial intermediate stage in quantitative data analysis. During this stage, data practitioners decide how to resolve dataset issues and transform, clean, and format the dataset(s). It
can be a challenging stage, full of decisions that have the potential to influence analytical outcomes. Yet, data preprocessing is often treated as behind-the-scenes work and overlooked in research dissemination. This discrepancy, in the practice and presentation of data analytics,
is limiting when it comes to replicating, interpreting, and utilising research outputs.

<br/>

The two central contributions in [Lydia's 2024 PhD Thesis](https://lydialucchesi.github.io/thesis/thesis_LydiaLucchesi.pdf) are Smallset Timelines and smallsets. The Smallset Timeline is a static
and compact visualisation, documenting the sequence of decisions in a preprocessing pipeline;
it is composed of small data snapshots of different preprocessing steps. The smallsets software builds a Smallset Timeline from a userâ€™s data preprocessing script, containing structured
comments with snapshot instructions. Together, Smallset Timelines and smallsets are designed to support the production of accessible data preprocessing documentation. 

This post illustrates these contributions with four examples, along with an example notebook that produces them. 

1. <a href="#EX1">Ebirds data in citizen science</a>
1. <a href="#EX2">HMDA homeloan data, reflecting nuances in defining and reporting on race</a>
1. <a href="#EX3">Examining fairness in income classification from American Community Survey</a>
1. <a href="#EX4">NASA software defect data</a>

We will conclude this overview with <a href="#notebook">an example notebook</a> to illustrate the ease of using smallsets in exisitng data-preprocessing code, along with an <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>.

<h5 id="faq"></h5>

#### **FAQ** (detailed answers coming soon, new questions most welcome)

* _Will smallsets automate data-preprocessing?_  In short, no. 
* _Is Python code supported?_ Yes, in ipython notebooks.
* _Will smallsets support preprocessing code across different scripts?_ Not yet. 
* _Will smallsets support word embeddings, large language models and the like?_  Not yet, let us know what you think are important to support.
